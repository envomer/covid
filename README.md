# Frontend development challenge

Unfortunately, COVID-19 is a serious issue nowadays. We would like you to create a SPA that helps to track data about this virus.
The SPA should consume data from https://covid19api.com/ and have the following features:
1. Display the data from the API in a tabular format, with the following columns:
    - Country name
    - The current total of the number of active cases,  since day 1
    - The current total of the number of deaths,  since day 1
    - The current total of the number of recoveries,  since day 1
2. The table view should also have a “TOTALS” row, which shows the sum of the displayed data in each column.
3. The user should be able to switch to another view that displays the data on a column chart.
4. In the UI, there should be an input field that
    - Autocompletes for country names
    - Filters/searches for the input value in the data (country names) so that the views reflect the filtered dataset in both the tabular and the chart view

### Premises
- Please, only use publicly available resources during the creation of the SPA.
- Please, publish the SPA so, that we can access both the UI (production version) and the development code, remotely.
- Please, use Twitter Bootstrap 4 as the UI library.
- Please, use Vue as the frontend framework (we are working with that).

If you have any questions or "blockers" regarding the task or premises, please feel free to send a question.
